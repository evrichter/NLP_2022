# ðŸ“˜ Natural Language Processing (SS 2022)  

This repository contains my solutions for **eight weekly assignments** from the *Natural Language Processing* course at **Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona)** in the **summer semester 2022**.  

The assignments covered practical implementations of core NLP techniques, ranging from basic text processing to neural language models.

**Assignment 1 â€” Intro to Python**  
Basic programming exercises to prepare for NLP tasks.  

**Assignment 2 â€” Regular Expressions**  
Pattern matching and text extraction using regex.  

**Assignment 3 â€” Text Normalization**  
Text normalization techniques, including tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, and lemmatization

**Assignment 4 â€” Sequence Labeling (POS & NER)**  
Implemented sequence labeling models for part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.  

**Assignment 5 â€” Information Extraction**  
Extracted structured information from unstructured text.  

**Assignment 6 â€” Sentiment Analysis**
